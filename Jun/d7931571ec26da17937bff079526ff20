Asian stocks looked set to decline as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned the downside risks to the U.S. economy have increased and doubts emerged on progress toward a trade deal with China. Treasuries rose and U.S. equities retreated. Futures pointed lower in Japan, Hong Kong and Australia. The S&P 500 Index fell 1% as Powell reiterated the case for looser policy, but stopped short of signaling a cut was imminent. Tech shares were under pressure as a senior Trump administration official told Bloomberg the U.S. won’t accept further conditions on tariffs as part of reopening negotiations and no detailed trade deal is expected from the G-20 leaders’ summit. The dollar rose and 10-year Treasury yields closed below 2%. “My biggest concern here is that people think higher tariffs, or the threat of higher tariffs, can be offset by the promise of lower rates,” David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told Bloomberg TV. “That’s not going to work.” Investor caution is returning ahead of a meeting between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping set for Saturday. The U.S. is willing to suspend the next round of tariffs on an additional $300 billion of Chinese imports while Beijing and Washington prepare to resume trade negotiations, people familiar with the plans said. Markets are betting the Fed will produce deep cuts to interest rates this year, and comments by officials Tuesday highlighted investor sensitivity to any hints that may not happen. Elsewhere, West Texas oil rose as an industry report suggested U.S. crude stockpiles continue to shrink. Bitcoin extended its gains through $11,000. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard says he’s not in favor of a 50 basis point rate cut.
