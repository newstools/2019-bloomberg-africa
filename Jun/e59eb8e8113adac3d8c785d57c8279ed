Among the axes sold: an iconic Fender used on “The Dark Side of the Moon.” The “Black Strat,” a 1969 Fender Stratocaster that Gilmour subsequently modified, was sold for $3,975,000 to Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay. The sum was the most ever paid for a guitar at auction, according to Christie’s. Gilmour’s Gretsch white penguin guitar on display at Christie’s in New York on June 14. Irsay also snapped up a C.F. Martin six-string acoustic that figured in the Pink Floyd tracks “Wish You Were Here” and “Shine On You Crazy Diamond.” The 73-year-old songwriter said he’ll donate the proceeds of the 127-lot sale to ClientEarth, a London-based environmental group. The previous record for an auctioned guitar was $2.7 million for a Fender Stratocaster signed by 19 musicians including Sting, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page to raise money after the 2004 Asian tsunami.
