Most stock markets in the Gulf declined as tension between the U.S. and Iran kept investors on high-alert. President Donald Trump said the U.S. will impose major new sanctions on Iran Monday, days after he abruptly called off a plan for airstrikes against the Islamic Republic, but gave no additional detail. The United Arab Emirates civil aviation authority ordered carriers to avoid risky air space, with Emirates and Etihad Airways re-routing flights away from areas of possible conflict. The warning of new sanctions “could be a reasonable settlement under the pretense that oil needs to continue flowing from the Gulf to the world,” said Mohammed Ali Yasin, the chief strategy officer at Al Dhabi Capital in Abu Dhabi. “If the pressure continues to be diplomatic, the status quo will continue. But it it becomes military action, it will affect every sector except telecoms.” That some local airlines have followed other carriers in changing flight paths has “scared people that military strikes are closer than ever before,” Yasin said.
