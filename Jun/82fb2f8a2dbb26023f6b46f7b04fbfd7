In the Gard department of southern France, fires fueled by wind and dry brush destroyed 11 houses and scorched 620 hectares (1,530 acres) of land, officials said, with some still not extinguished Saturday morning. Record temperatures for the month of June were reached this week in Germany, the Czech Republic and Poland, according to Swedish forecaster SMHI. France set an all-time record on Friday of 45.9 degrees Celsius, or 114.6 Fahrenheit, in the town of Gallargues-le-Montueux near the Mediterranean Sea.
