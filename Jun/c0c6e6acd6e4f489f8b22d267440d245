At the time, the central bank also said the economy will probably contract 0.4% this year. The revision comes amid a disastrous fishing season. “We have never been as well prepared in our history to deal with adverse situation as we are now,” he said. “We have policy space, with a lot of scope to cut rate if necessary.” The government has also said that it’s standing by to boost stimulus should it be needed, preparing to trim planned surpluses. — With assistance by Andrea Dudik, and Ragnhildur Sigurdardottir
