Treasury yields slid and the dollar weakened after the Federal Reserve struck a dovish tone in its latest policy statement. Asian equities looked set for a muted start after U.S. shares edged higher. Futures were little changed in Japan and Australia. Earlier, the S&P 500 Index rose as the Fed indicated an increased readiness to cut interest rates and the yield on two-year Treasuries slumped. Next up comes the Bank of Japan policy decision, where government-bond yields Wednesday touched a fresh three-year low. Seven of 17 Federal Reserve officials now think it will be appropriate to lower the benchmark overnight rate by a half-percentage point by the end of the year, according to updated projections published Wednesday. The Fed cited “uncertainties” in the outlook that have increased the case for a rate reduction as officials seek to prolong the near-record U.S. economic expansion. “This was a more dovish result than many had expected,” Tiffany Wilding, U.S. economist at Pacific Investment Management Co., told Bloomberg TV. “When you have heightened uncertainty and potential trade-policy shocks at a time when the economy is already in a fragile state, it makes sense for the Federal Reserve from a risk management perspective to really guide towards interest-rate cuts if they are needed.” Bond traders are virtually certain that the Fed will ease policy as soon as next month. The rate implied for the July 31 Fed decision dropped by 7 basis points to about 2.06%. That suggests about 31 basis points of rate cuts by then. The January 2020 fed funds futures contract implies close to 75 basis points of easing by the end of 2019.
