France and Germany are still in talks over the export policy they will adopt for the future combat plane, a matter of particular focus because of Germany’s ban on arms exports to Saudi Arabia. Officials said the accord on exports wouldn’t go into detail, such as naming countries. Half the business for such a plane would be in exports and the project could be hampered if the rules are too strict, they said.
