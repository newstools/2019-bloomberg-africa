That’s where we are now.” Lungu’s government is trying to revive an economy that the International Monetary Fund says is growing at the slowest pace in more than two decades, after a slump in the price of copper, Zambia’s main export, over the past year. A drought has also lowered water levels at hydro plants and caused power shortages. Spreads on Zambia’s dollar bonds hit 2,000 basis points above U.S. Treasuries last month as investors fretted about its ability to pay off debts. It’s the only country in the Bloomberg Barclays Emerging Markets USD Sovereign Bond Index, which includes 75 nations, whose securities have lost money in 2019.

In a few years, we will see Zambia boomerang and rise again to that growth rate which is acceptable.” — With assistance by Paul Wallace
