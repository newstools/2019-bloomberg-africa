Sign up to the Brussels Edition, a daily morning briefing on what matters most in the heart of the European Union. Mario Draghi told the European Union that additional monetary stimulus and a much more expansionary fiscal policy may be needed to overcome persistent economic weakness, at a summit that also saw him win a standing ovation from leaders. The European Central Bank president said the euro zone’s rebound from an economic slowdown last year has been weaker than expected, largely because of pervasive uncertainty in global trade, according to a person familiar with the behind-closed-doors discussion. In the absence of an improvement to the outlook for inflation, additional monetary stimulus will be required, Draghi said.

Telling them this was his last summit, he was greeted with a standing ovation from his peers, according to the person. Leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte took the floor to praise his work.
