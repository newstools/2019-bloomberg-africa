The sweltering heat echoes a sustained drought in 2018 across Germany that halted shipping on the Rhine River, hampered power generation, sparked forest fires and forced the country to import grain for the first time in 24 years. Read more about the recent heatwave that hit Germany. Under the Paris climate accord, Germany has pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 55% by 2030. However, it’s falling behind and a cut of only 32% is expected by next year. The government’s climate cabinet will decide later this year what measures to take to cut CO2 pollution caused by vehicles and buildings. In her podcast, the chancellor said the government has introduced a program to make towns and cities “greener,” and is helping farmers to overcome extreme weather conditions from droughts to torrential rain. Part of the solution is to develop soil and crops that are more resistant to climate change, Merkel said.
