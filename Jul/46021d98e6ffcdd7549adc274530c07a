Bain Capital and Carlyle Group LP have made a 3.4 billion euro ($3.8 billion) bid to acquire German lighting firm Osram Licht AG, concluding months of negotiations for the long-sought deal. Osram confirmed Wednesday that it had a received a binding offer at 35 euros a share and that it would decide “shortly” whether to accept it. Its supervisory board is scheduled to meet Thursday to vote on the agreement, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Osram shares surged as much as 13%, the most since February, after Reuters reported earlier on the bid. They rose 12% to 32.25 euros in Frankfurt. Representatives from Carlyle and Bain declined to comment. “A 35 euro-a-share bid implies an enterprise value of 3.9 billion euros and a 12-month forward EV/Ebitda multiple of 7.7x, based on our scenario analysis. This is slightly above the 7.5x average for the BI global lighting peer group and seems fair, given Osram’s dim profit outlook and high exposure to the beleaguered automotive end-market.” -- Jawahar Hingorani, European industrials analyst Click here to read the research Negotiations to buy Osram have moved slowly since they were first revealed in February.

The company said in May the general economic slowdown is hurting its business. Read more: Osram Stands by Outlook as Takeover Talks Continue
