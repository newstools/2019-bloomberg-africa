Nigeria also has the ninth largest gas reserves at 201 trillion cubic feet and an estimated potential of 600 trillion cubic feet, he said. These resources provide opportunities for investors and the government is determined to create the environment that will help drive the necessary investments in a sustainable manner, according to the state oil company. Given growing local demand for petroleum products, the NNPC has undergone a shift in its business model to focus more on domestic refining of crude. “The recent fiscal challenge experienced by the nation places a burden for change,”Baru said. “Hence, we have undertaken to broaden the base of investment sources.” Baru, who will officially retire from the corporation on July 7, will be succeeded by Mele Kyari, the former head of the crude-marketing division.
