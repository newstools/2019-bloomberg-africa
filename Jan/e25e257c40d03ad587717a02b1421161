Dubai’s homeowners will have to wait at least a couple more years for a long-running property slump to hit bottom as developers put a record number of new residences on the market this year. About 31,500 homes will probably be completed this year, more than twice the city’s average annual demand over the last five years, according to Craig Plumb, head of Middle East research at broker Jones Lang Lasalle.

JLL expects values to decline by 5 percent to 10 percent this year.

The government owns the developer of man-made islands, Nakheel PJSC and Dubai Properties Group. It also holds 29 percent of builder Emaar Properties PJSC, which built the world’s tallest tower in the city.
