The shootings occurred in Omdurman, the twin city of the capital, Khartoum, on Wednesday, the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors, an independent medical group, said in a statement handed to reporters. A further six people were injured at the demonstration that was held at the same time as a pro-government rally in Khartoum, it said.
