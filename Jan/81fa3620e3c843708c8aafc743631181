The Louvre also mentioned in a statement Thursday the success of its flagship exhibition on French master Delacroix as a reason for the record. The video of Beyonce and her husband Jay Z, featuring the Mona Lisa and other world-famous artworks, has been viewed over 146 million times on YouTube. The museum notes a significant rise in the number of foreign visitors —almost three-quarters of total visitor numbers — mostly from the United States, China, other European countries and Brazil. Tourism in the French capital has rebounded since 2017 after a sharp fall following 2015 terror attacks.
