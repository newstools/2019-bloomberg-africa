Ravalomanana claims the Dec. 19 ballot, in which the electoral commission declared rival candidate Andry Rajoelina the provisional winner, was rigged and demanded a review by the Constitutional Court. The court is scheduled to announce the final results on Jan. 8. Police and army forces clashed with Ravalomanana’s supporters in Antananarivo, the capital, on Saturday, a day after the government ordered tighter security in the city and banned further rallies.
