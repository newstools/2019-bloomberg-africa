It’s the latest salvo in a long-lasting battle between the EU and Poland over what Brussels considers an erosion of democratic standards and threats to the rule of law. The standoff centers around political appointments to Poland’s independent judiciary and the conflict could result in cuts to subsidies the country receives from the bloc’s budget.

While Poland is a “positive example” of a nation without strong anti-European forces in its parliament, steps taken by EU institutions are meant to “hurt Polish authorities as much as possible,” according to the minister. “The European commonwealth is functioning badly,” Czaputowicz said on the RMF Radio when asked about the EU elections. “The EU can’t conduct actions which don’t have public acceptance.” The comments came just days before the ruling party Chairman Jaroslaw Kaczynski meets Italy’s Deputy Premier Matteo Salvini, a member of a populist government that was also embroiled in a confrontation with the EU over its budget. Czaputowicz said the Wednesday’s meeting with Salvini, a euroskeptic leader of the anti-immigration League in Italy, is justified and needed. “We have to discuss the issues relating to elections to the European Parliament as well as the state of our relations,” said the minister.
