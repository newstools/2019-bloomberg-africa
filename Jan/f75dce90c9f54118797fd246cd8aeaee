Restaurant operator Carluccio’s will pay its more than 1,500 workers from the European Union to gain residence status that lets them remain in Britain after Brexit and apply for U.K. citizenship. Carluccio’s, based in London with 75 restaurants in the U.K., is the first food-service operator to make such an offer, the company said in a statement Saturday. “It’s what Antonio would have wanted,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Jones said, referring to founder Antonio Carluccio, who was 80 when he died in 2017. “There would be no Carluccio’s without one man making the journey from Europe to London. Today we employ over 2,300 people from over 80 countries.” Under the U.K. plan, all EU citizens in the U.K. need to apply for the right to remain after Brexit. The application fee is 65 pounds ($82.70) and gives workers living in Britain for five years or more “settled status.” “We appreciate that the current political landscape is unsettling for many of our employees and we want to do everything we can to reassure them that they are part of the Carluccio’s famiglia,” Jones said.
