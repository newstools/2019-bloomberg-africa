Musk also tweeted a mock-up picture of the Starship test vehicle currently under assembly in Boca Chica, Texas. Musk said the first hopper engine to be fired is almost finished being assembled in California. "Probably fires next month," Musk said. The engines currently on the Starship hopper are a mix of Raptor development and operational parts, according to Musk. Starship is the new name of SpaceX’s BFR. Elon Musk described it in a tweet as the spaceship needed "to escape Earth’s deep gravity well." Musk tweeted the name change last Nov. 19.
