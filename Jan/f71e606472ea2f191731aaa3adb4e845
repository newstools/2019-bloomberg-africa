Police on Wednesday fired teargas to disperse protesters who breached a security cordon in Antananarivo, L’Express de Madagascar reported. The protesters also blocked roads with burning tires, according to the newspaper. Ravalomanana garnered 44 percent of votes in the Dec. 19 runoff vote against Andry Rajoelina, who secured 56 percent, according to the electoral commission. The country’s Constitutional Court is reviewing a petition filed by Ravalomanana challenging the result and is due to announce its decision by Jan. 15. Millionaire businessman Ravalomanana led the Indian Ocean nation, the world’s biggest producer of vanilla, from 2002 to 2009 before being overthrown in a coup by Rajoelina, a former nightclub DJ and ex-mayor of Antananarivo. Both men were banned from contesting the 2013 election as part of an international agreement to end the country’s political crisis.
