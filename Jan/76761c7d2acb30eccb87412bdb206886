Saudi Arabia held its first session in the murder trial of government critic Jamal Khashoggi, whose killing at the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul has rattled relations with the West. Eleven suspects and their lawyers were present at the proceeding in Riyadh. Prosecutors are still waiting for evidence from Turkey, and the interrogation of some of the suspects continues, state-run Saudi Press Agency reported. The court granted the lawyers’ request for time to respond to the indictment. Khashoggi was a critic of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman’s policies, and intelligence leaks from Turkey have suggested the prince had a role in the decision to kill him, something Saudi Arabia denies. There was no advance notice of the court session and no footage of the proceedings was immediately shared on state-run television or media. The public prosecutor has requested the death penalty for five of the suspects. Saudi trials are largely closed to media, and Cinzia Bianco, a Middle East and Gulf analyst for Gulf State Analytics in London, said she didn’t expect a public trial in this case, either. The case is highly politicized “and much more complex than it appears just based on the evidence being shared with the public,” Bianco said. Khashoggi was killed by Saudi agents at the consulate on Oct. 2. His death sparked an international uproar, leading the U.S. and Germany to rethink their arms sales to the kingdom. — With assistance by Donna Abu-Nasr
