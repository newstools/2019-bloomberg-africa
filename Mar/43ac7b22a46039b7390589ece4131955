If U.K. markets are any indication, Tuesday night could shape up to be the season finale of a year of Brexit drama. Yes, we’ve all been fooled before. But after Prime Minister Theresa May announced the latest deal with the European Union late Monday, all the good market omens aligned: The pound surged, U.K. large caps fell, and domestic champions climbed. If the plan fails again, there are still other market-friendly paths: a vote against a no-deal divorce and another to delay Britain’s departure. U.K. domestic stocks have already rebounded this year as the odds of a chaotic exit fell, but persistently low expectations for May means there’s probably still room for a bounce if her accord passes. The latest deal “provides greater probability of the deal passing, but if it doesn’t, then the only way to avoid a hard Brexit will be through an extension, as it is unlikely the EU will provide any further concession,” said Roger Jones, head of equities at London and Capital Asset Management. The terms of the extension will be key to the market. A three-month delay hardly lifts fears of a “cliff edge,” while a 21-month one will be much more heartening to local British stocks, and, conversely, negative for U.K.-listed multinationals, said Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald Asset Management.

Stay tuned to see if this evening leaves us with a cliffhanger.
