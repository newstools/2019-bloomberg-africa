South Africaâ€™s economic growth slowed less than expected in the fourth quarter as domestic fixed investment slumped. Annualized growth in gross domestic product eased to 1.4 percent in the final quarter from a revised 2.6 percent the prior three months, Statistics South Africa said Tuesday in the capital, Pretoria. The economy grew 0.8 percent in 2018 compared with a revised 1.4 percent in the prior year.
