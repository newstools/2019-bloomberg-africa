The latest maneuvering could open the door for the embattled British leader to win a Brexit vote in Parliament within days, the newspaper reported, citing a document drafted by the so-called European Research Group within the party. The document cites three tests: a demand for a legally binding clause that “unambiguously overrides” the text of the withdrawal agreement, stronger language that the so-called Irish border backstop will be temporary and a “clear and unconditional route out of the backstop if trade talks fail.” With the U.K. due to leave the EU on March 29, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox is looking for a way around the problem of the contentious Irish border question. May has promised to have another Brexit vote in Parliament by March 12.
