A European Commission money-laundering blacklist, which ranks Saudi Arabia as a high-risk country, is “the right thing” to fight money laundering and terrorist financing, the European Union’s justice chief argued as EU members states threatened to vote against the list this week. The list of jurisdictions with inadequate controls on illicit transactions and terrorism financing was proposed by the EU’s executive authority last month and was quickly criticized by the U.S. Treasury as the result of a flawed process. “I am absolutely convinced that we did the right thing,” EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova told a European Parliament committee Tuesday. “I personally gave a lot of commitments and promises to European people that we will efficiently fight against money-laundering and terrorist financing. Those who lobbied me very heavily before we adopted this list, maybe were not aware that for me these promises are a very strong motivation.” Officials representing the bloc’s national governments met in Brussels March 1 and agreed to ask the commission to revise the procedure of drafting the blacklist. Member states will demand a “transparent and credible process" and a “listing that meets our high standards and thereby further strengthens" measures to combat laundering and terrorist financing, according to a draft joint statement under deliberation, which was seen by Bloomberg. It’s expected to be released this week. “I have a suspicion that the lobbying effect of the member states brought some fruits,” Jourova said. “It’s just a speculation. I did not ask the member states why they are opposing. I will ask the member states in the near future what shall we do together to achieve this goal.” A rejection by EU governments would mean the commission will have to rethink its approach.
