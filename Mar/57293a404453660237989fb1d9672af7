Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk is having a harder time keeping people employed than he bargained for eight months ago. When the chief executive officer announced plans to dismiss about 9 percent of the electric-car maker’s workforce in June, he wrote in an internal memo that Tesla was “making this hard decision now so that we never have to do this again.” On Thursday, Musk told workers more jobs will be cut as Tesla winds down most stores worldwide and transitions to online-only ordering. This is the second culling the billionaire has announced this year -- he said in January the company had “no choice” but to reduce headcount by about 7 percent. Musk, 47, didn’t specify in his latest email to employees how many jobs will be impacted by the shift to online sales and said some workers will transition to other areas of the business. He also wrote that he expects headcount will increase next year.

Tesla shares fell 7.8 percent, the biggest drop in six weeks, to close at $294.79 on Friday. — With assistance by Dana Hull
