I assure you that I will not let you down.” The 76-year-old leader decisively beat his main rival, Atiku Abubakar, in a Feb. 23 election to secure a final four-year term. After a contraction in 2016, the economy of Africa’s biggest oil producer is still recovering and the nation faces several security challenges, including from Boko Haram and Islamic State militants in the northeast.
