Rwanda said Uganda arrested and tortured 190 Rwandan citizens in the past couple of years, part of a string of accusations the two neighbors have slung at each other in recent weeks as diplomatic tensions heighten. Uganda has also deported 986 Rwandan citizens, Rwanda’s foreign minister, Richard Sezibera, told reporters in the capital, Kigali. His comments come after the government warned Rwandans over the weekend against traveling to Uganda and closed one of its border points with the country, citing road construction. “We have been in negotiations with Uganda for the last two years to sort out the issue,” Sezibera said, referring to the alleged arrests and torture of Rwandans. “Negotiations are ongoing.” Rwandan traders in Uganda are being frustrated by authorities there and their goods are being blocked without an explanation, Sezibera said. Rwanda exports goods worth only 91 million francs ($101,110) to Uganda, he said. Sezibera also accused Uganda of supporting the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, a rebel group sheltering in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo that goes by the French acronym FDLR, made up of some of the fighters that carried out the genocide in 1994. Ugandan government spokesman Ofwono Opondo did not answer calls to his mobile phone. — With assistance by Fred Ojambo
