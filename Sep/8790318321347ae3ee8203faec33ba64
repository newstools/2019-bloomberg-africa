Dubai will set up a committee to balance property supply and demand as a slump in prices weighs on developers in the Middle East’s business hub.

Members of the committee will include companies such as Emaar Properties PJSC, Nakheel PJSC, Dubai Properties Group and Meraas Holding LLC, according to a statement posted on the government’s Media Office website.
