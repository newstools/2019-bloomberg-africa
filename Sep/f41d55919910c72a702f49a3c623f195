Boris Johnson welcomed his newly adopted Jack Russell puppy to his London home as the U.K. prime minister called an emergency meeting of his Cabinet, prompting fresh speculation there will be a general election. The new Downing Street dog arrives at number 10 on Sept. 2. Just weeks ago the 15-week-old dog, named Dilyn according to a post on Twitter by Johnson’s partner Carrie Symonds, faced death after being abandoned by a south Wales puppy farmer as his misaligned jaw meant he would be difficult to sell. He was saved by a volunteer-run rescue charity in south Wales. Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, was encouraged to get a dog to increase her appeal to voters, but refused because she was concerned about who would look after it.
