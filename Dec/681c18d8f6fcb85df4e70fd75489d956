Treasuries stabilized after declines. Equity benchmarks opened higher in Tokyo, Sydney and Seoul. Gains were modest with the key Dec. 15 U.S.-China tariff deadline looming with no specific plan for a trade deal. Weekend data showing a drop in Chinese exports underlined the stakes for growth. S&P 500 futures were flat after the index logged gains Friday after reports showing payrolls jumped the most since January, wages beat estimates and consumer sentiment increased. Treasury yields were steady after climbing above 1.80%. Stocks were whipsawed last week on conflicting signs on progress in trade negotiations between the world’s two-largest economies. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Friday the two sides are haggling over the amount of U.S. farm products Beijing is willing to purchase. Meantime, China’s exports fell 1.1% in November, with those to the U.S. tumbling 23%, underscoring why the nation may want a trade deal. Also in focus for investors are central banks, with policy meetings at the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank this week, which may offer clues on whether more monetary easing is in store in 2020. Elsewhere, oil trimmed a rally spurred by Saudi Arabia promising significant additional production cuts beyond what was agreed with fellow OPEC+ members, to dip below $58 a barrel.
