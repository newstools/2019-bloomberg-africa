Yemeni forces backed by warplanes from the Saudi-led coalition have recaptured the areaâ€™s largest training camp for al-Qaeda militants, in the southern province of Abyan, local newspaper Aden Al-Ghad reported. Antimilitant operations are continuing in the region after security forces recaptured the camp, at Omairan valley in the district of Mudiah, the newspaper said. Abyan has been one of the main strongholds of the group known as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and was under the full control of the militants in 2011 before they were driven out the following year.
