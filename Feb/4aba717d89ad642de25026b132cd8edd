Warren Buffett says he wants to spend Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s growing pile of cash on a giant acquisition, but he doesn’t see that happening anytime soon. “Prices are sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects,” Buffett wrote in his annual letter to investors, adding that will lead to buying more public stocks in 2019. “We continue, nevertheless, to hope for an elephant-sized acquisition.” Read Warren Buffett’s annual letter to investors. Berkshire’s cash pile rose to $112 billion, showing how hard it’s been for Buffett to put money to work as fast as Berkshire accumulates it. The legendary investor made his name by consistently outpacing the broader market, but that’s become harder as Berkshire has grown. While the company’s book value has increased at almost twice the rate of the S&P during his career, it has actually trailed the index over the last decade. Berkshire slowed its stock buybacks in the fourth quarter, repurchasing $418 million of shares, down from $928 million in the third quarter. The board loosened its policy on stock buybacks in July, allowing Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger to buy back shares whenever the price was below what they considered the intrinsic value. The Berkshire CEO said in his annual letter to investors Saturday that the company will probably become a “significant repurchaser” of its own stock in coming years. — With assistance by Michelle Kim
