Deutsche Bank AG racked up $1.6 billion in losses tied to a portfolio of municipal bonds and related derivatives that the lender offloaded in 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported. The bank faced internal questions over a number of years about whether it was recognizing the losses quickly enough on the portfolio it bought in 2007, the Journal reported, citing bank documents and people it didn’t name. The company recognized the majority of the loss in 2015 and 2016, the paper said. In its 2016 annual report, the firm told investors it had “de-risking losses” of 821 million euros ($864 million), “mainly from the unwind of long dated derivative exposures and related assets.” “This transaction was unwound in 2016 as part of the closure of our Non-Core Operations Unit (NCOU),” Troy Gravitt, a spokesman for the bank in New York, said in an emailed statement. “External lawyers and auditors reviewed the transaction and confirmed it was in line with accounting standards and practices.” The muni portfolio included insurance from monoline bond insurers, and Deutsche Bank bought additional protection from Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in 2008, the Journal reported.
