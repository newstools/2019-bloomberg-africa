U.K. financial firms were dealt a blow after European Union policy makers agreed to tighten the rules governing the City of London’s access to the bloc after Brexit. The European Commission will gain greater powers in determining who will be given access to EU clients, according to a statement from the Council of the EU, which represents national governments. Under a deal reached late Tuesday, the EU’s member states and the European Parliament fleshed out existing requirements for allowing firms abroad to do business in the bloc. “In particular, the commission is charged with assessing capital requirements applicable to firms providing bank-like services,” the council said. The strictest requirements apply when activities “are likely to be of systemic importance,” it said. At issue are the so-called “equivalence” rules that the EU has said is all the U.K. financial industry can hope for after Brexit. Under that system, officials in Brussels determine whether a country’s rules are as tough as the ones in the EU, potentially allowing firms based there to sell services to customers in the bloc.

While U.K. officials initially dismissed the equivalence framework as inadequate, they later agreed to it when they settled on a “political declaration” that outlines the future relationship between the EU and Britain. Tuesday’s changes apply to investment services, such as advice on mergers and acquisitions or helping clients raise capital. More-traditional banking activities, like deposit taking and lending, aren’t covered by any third-country regime and require firms to set up shop in the EU before they can serve clients there.
