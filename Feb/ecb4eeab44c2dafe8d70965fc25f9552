EU foreign ministers agreed in principle on Monday to expand from 164 the number of individuals subject to asset freezes and travel bans as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, where Russia annexed the region of Crimea in 2014 and has supported separatist rebels. “There is political consensus on some further measures to be taken -- personal, targeted sanctions,” EU foreign-policy chief Federica Mogherini told reporters in Brussels after the meeting. “I believe the formal adoption of the legal acts will be finalized in the coming days.” While Mogherini declined to elaborate, an EU official who spoke on the condition of anonymity following the gathering of foreign ministers said the bloc planned to sanction eight additional people. That’s consistent with information that emerged last Friday after EU technocrats worked on the matter. The latest move to expand the EU blacklist is a response to a naval clash in the Sea of Azov last November, when Russia fired on and captured three Ukrainian vessels and 24 sailors. The identities of the people to be added will be disclosed after the decision is taken and published in the EU’s Official Journal. Those steps could take another 10 days to two weeks, according to the official who spoke anonymously on Monday.
