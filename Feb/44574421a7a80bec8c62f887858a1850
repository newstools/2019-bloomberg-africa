Nigerian banking stocks slumped the most since June 2016 a day after the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari, as some investors showed disappointment at the defeat of his market-friendly opponent. An index of Nigeria’s 10 largest banking stocks dropped 4.6 percent by the close in Lagos Thursday, while the country’s benchmark stocks index retreated for a third day. The Lagos market’s biggest laggers by index points were Guaranty Trust Bank Plc, which dropped 6.9 percent, Zenith Bank Plc, which fell 4 percent and Nigerian Breweries Plc, down 4.5 percent.

Buhari easily won a second term as president of Africa’s biggest oil producer with promises to revive an anemic economy and tackle security threats including a devastating insurgency by Islamic State. His main opponent, Atiku Abubakar, who was seen as favored by investors, has rejected the results of the weekend vote.
