Boeing Co. shares have a “clear path” to $500 given broadly higher market multiples, along with a potential order boost from a resolution in the China trade situation, Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani wrote in a note to clients. “The combination of a healthy free cash flow yield, a stable commercial aerospace backdrop, and positive upcoming data points” support continued upward momentum in Boeing shares, the analyst added, and raised his price target on the stock to $500 from $450. He maintained the overweight rating. At $505, First Shanghai Securities is the only analyst with a price target over $500 on Boeing, and Melius Research also has a $500 target, according to Bloomberg data. Boeing shares have gained 35 percent this year, making it the top gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
