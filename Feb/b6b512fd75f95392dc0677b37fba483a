Asian stocks were mixed on Tuesday, with several markets slipping as the rush of optimism on U.S.-China trade talks from early Monday faded some. The pound advanced on the possibility of a Brexit delay. Shares fell in Hong Kong and Australia and were little changed in Japan and China. S&P 500 Index futures dipped after the gauge closed at the highest in almost four months Monday. While U.S. President Donald Trump raised the possibility of signing a new trade deal with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, he also said Monday an agreement “might not happen at all.” Oil held losses after tumbling the most in four weeks on Trump’s criticism that prices are too high. Traders will be looking for any signs that the progress on trade is enough to build on a global rally in equities that has been tested by slowing economic growth.

The pound climbed as Prime Minister Theresa May is considering a plan to delay Brexit and stop the U.K. leaving the European Union with no deal next month, according to people familiar with the situation.
