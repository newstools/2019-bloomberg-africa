Sterling has lost more than 1 percent in February and 10-year U.K. bond yields have dropped to an eight-month low as Prime Minister Theresa May struggles to gain EU concessions to make her divorce deal palatable to lawmakers at home. The Independent Group of Members of Parliament formed by the ex-Labour lawmakers could see some pro-EU Conservative Party members also join, and raises the chance of a harsh Brexit, according to Mizuho.
