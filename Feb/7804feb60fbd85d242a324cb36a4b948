If President Muhammadu Buhari wins another four-year term it will probably mean more political interference in Nigeria’s economy and slower growth, according to research by Bloomberg Economics. The opening of the Egina offshore oilfield this month and the Dangote refinery next year will deliver a near-term boost, but low capital investment is likely to inhibit growth over the medium term. BE expects Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer, to keep losing ground in real GDP per capita against its peers in Sub-Saharan Africa.
