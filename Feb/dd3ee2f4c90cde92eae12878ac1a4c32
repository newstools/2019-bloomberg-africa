Liberian President George Weah declared Monday a day of national mourning after more than 40 people were killed in a mudslide at an alleged illegal mine in the north of the country. The national disaster management agency has been searching for survivors since the incident in Nimba County last weekend, but the region is inaccessible and getting the necessary equipment there is posing a challenge, a spokesperson said. The president also declared the region a national disaster zone and ordered authorities to isolate the area, provide security and prevent illicit mining. “It is totally depressing for our country at a time my government is endeavoring to create an enabling environment for our people to improve their lives,” said Weah. He assured victims’ families that the government would provide support and assistance.
