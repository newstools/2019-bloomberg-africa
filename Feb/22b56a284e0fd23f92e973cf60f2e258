The search continues for dozens more miners who are still trapped in the shafts. Eight miners were pulled out alive on Saturday, four days after the tunnels collapsed following flooding. Seven of them have been treated and discharged from hospital, and a team of four is still underground pumping out the water, Rushwaya said. Most of Zimbabwe’s gold is produced by small-scale miners, who mainly work in unsafe and disused mines. The country produced 33.3 tons of the metal last year.
