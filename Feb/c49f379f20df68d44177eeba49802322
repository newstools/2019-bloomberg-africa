Asian stocks edged higher Wednesday, with positive sentiment kept in check after a Wall Street advance fizzled as investors found little in Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s Congress testimony to extend the recent rally. The dollar held overnight losses and Treasuries steadied. Equities posted modest gains in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong and China. Earlier, the S&P 500 Index dropped in the final hour of trading to close in the red after Powell warned that growth looked uneven and policy makers will be patient on interest-rate adjustments. The pound retained gains spurred by a promise from U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May for a vote to delay Brexit if her proposed deal fails. Trading in futures on U.S. Treasuries and the S&P 500 was impacted due to a technical problem at CME Group Inc. Silver spiked as much as 4 percent before pulling back. Powell said with inflation pressures muted and ongoing government policy uncertainty, a patient approach to future policy changes was warranted. “Going forward, our policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and will take into account new information as economic conditions and the outlook evolve,’’ he told the Senate Banking Committee. Investors are still grappling with a host of uncertainties from further developments on trade to Brexit that could rein in a recovery in global equities from December lows. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump is in Hanoi for a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Elsewhere, oil climbed, reversing a loss from earlier in the week that were spurred by criticism from President Donald Trump that prices are too high. Silver was 1.1 percent higher after a brief surge to the highest level since June. Here are some key events coming up: These are the main moves in markets: — With assistance by Adam Haigh
