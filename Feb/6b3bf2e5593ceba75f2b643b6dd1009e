Eskom Holdings SOC is to implement rotational power cuts for a third day, shedding 3,000 megawatts from the South African national power grid from 8 a.m. The power cuts are expected to continue until 11 p.m., the debt-laden state-owned utility said in a statement on Twitter. “Despite the generating units returning to service as planned, the emergency reserves (diesel and water) are still very low.” On Monday, Eskom raced to stabilize the grid by resorting to the most intense supply cuts in four years, when it removed as much as 4,000 megawatts from the grid. This followed power cuts of 2,000 megawatts on Sunday. On Monday night, four of the units were returned to service and it expects the remaining three units to be back up by this morning. The board is embarking on an in-depth audit of the entire system.
